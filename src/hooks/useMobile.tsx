/**
 * Extra notes:
 * 
 * In the context of the provided code snippet, the "debounce" and "throttle" functions refer to two different techniques used to control 
 * the frequency of event callbacks, especially for events that can trigger rapidly (like the resize event in this case).
 * 
 * Debounce Function:
 * A debounce function is used to delay the execution of a callback function until after a certain amount of time has passed since the 
 * last time the event was triggered. It is helpful when you want to handle events that fire rapidly, such as the resize event, 
 * but you only want to perform the associated action once a specific time has elapsed since the last event.
 * 
 * For example, if you debounce the resize event with a time of 200 milliseconds, the event listener will only execute the callback after 
 * the user stops resizing the window for at least 200 milliseconds.
 * 
 * Throttle Function:
 * A throttle function is used to limit the number of times a callback function is executed within a specific time interval. 
 * It prevents the callback from being invoked too frequently, even if the event is triggered rapidly. 
 * Unlike debounce, throttle guarantees that the callback will be executed at a regular interval.
 * 
 * For example, if you throttle the resize event with a time interval of 200 milliseconds, the event listener will execute the callback
 * at most once every 200 milliseconds, regardless of how many times the event is triggered within that time frame.
 * 
 * Both debounce and throttle functions are helpful for performance optimization and preventing excessive processing or rendering 
 * triggered by fast and repetitive events.
